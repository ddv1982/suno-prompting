# Suno V5: The Ultimate Prompting & Music Creation Guide

This guide is designed to help you master **Suno V5**, the most advanced AI music generation model to date. With higher fidelity, better structural awareness, and an improved vocal engine, V5 allows for professional-grade results when prompted correctly.

## 1. The V5 "Intelligent Composition Architecture"
Suno V5 isn't just a quality upgrade; it's a structural one. It maintains thematic consistency across 3-4 minute tracks and follows complex instructions more reliably than previous versions.

*   **Studio-Grade Fidelity:** Clearer instrument separation and reduced "mud" in the mix.
*   **Structural Awareness:** The model understands the relationship between different song sections (e.g., how a Verse should build into a Chorus).
*   **Refined Vocal Engine:** Better syllable alignment and handling of complex phrasing.

## 2. The "Top-Anchor" Strategy
The single most important habit for V5 is the **Top-Anchor**. Start your "Style of Music" box or the beginning of your prompt with a concise, declarative summary.

**Formula:** `[Vocal Persona] + [Mood] + [BPM/Tempo] + [Genre/Era] + [Key]`

> **Example:** `Female mid-range vocal, soulful and breathy, 90 BPM, 1970s Funk & Soul, Key: C Minor`

## 3. Instrumentation & Arrangement
V5 follows specific instrument tags with much higher accuracy. Use adjectives to define the *character* of the sound.

### Core Instrument Palette
*   **Rhythm:** `Funk slap bass`, `Sub-bass`, `808 sub`, `Double bass`, `Fretless bass`.
*   **Drums:** `Tight dry drums`, `Reverberant stadium drums`, `Trap hats`, `Brush snare`, `Taiko percussion`.
*   **Guitars:** `Spanish nylon guitar`, `Muted electric pluck`, `Distorted power chords`, `Clean jazz hollow-body`.
*   **Keys:** `Lo-fi Rhodes`, `Grand piano`, `Hammond B3 organ`, `Moog lead synth`, `80s FM poly-synth`.

### Section-Specific Arrangement
You can instruct Suno on which instruments to use in specific sections using the `[SECTION] instruments` format.

> **Example:**
> `[VERSE] Acoustic guitar arpeggio + soft strings`
> `[CHORUS] Full band, driving drums, electric guitar power chords, synth brass stabs`
> `[BRIDGE] Solo piano, atmospheric pads, no drums`

## 4. Vocal Mastery & Performance Cues
Control the "human" element of the performance using inline tags and punctuation.

### Inline Performance Tags
Place these in parentheses within your lyrics to nudge the vocal delivery:
*   `(breathy)` - Intimate, airy delivery.
*   `(belt)` - High power, louder delivery.
*   `(whisper)` - Quiet, hushed tone.
*   `(ad-lib)` - Background vocal flourishes.
*   `(hold)` - Sustain the previous syllable.

### Phrasing & Cadence
*   **Hyphenation:** Use `lo-ove` to force the AI to sing a word across two notes.
*   **Vowel Elongation:** Use `looove` to suggest a longer, sustained note.
*   **Punctuation:** Commas `,` act as short breaths; Ellipses `...` act as longer pauses/rests.

## 5. Styles, Chords, and Musicality
V5 understands musical theory concepts better than its predecessors.

*   **Key Selection:** Specify `Key: G Major` or `Key: A Minor` to set the emotional tone.
*   **Genre Fusions:** V5 excels at "fracture" prompting (mixing unrelated genres).
    *   `Gospel choir + Heavy Metal`
    *   `Lo-fi hip hop + Kalimba + Muted Trumpet`
    *   `Cyberpunk synthwave + Flamenco guitar`
*   **Tempo:** Always include a BPM for rhythmic precision (e.g., `128 BPM` for House, `90 BPM` for Hip Hop).

## 6. Pro Tips for "Lyric-First" Creators
If you want Suno to follow your lyrics 100% without improvisation:

1.  **Strict Instruction:** Add `(Sing exactly as written. Do not change words.)` at the top of the lyrics field.
2.  **Redundancy:** If the chorus repeats, **paste it again** in full. Don't rely on `[Repeat Chorus]`.
3.  **Syllable Control:** Keep your meter consistent. If one line has 8 syllables and the next has 20, the AI will likely "mumble" or rush the long line. Aim for balanced syllable counts per line.

---

### The "GM Formula"
Most successful prompts follow the **GM Structure**:
1.  **Genre:** (e.g., *Cinematic Synthwave*)
2.  **Mood:** (e.g., *Tense, dark, futuristic*)
3.  **Instruments:** (e.g., *Analog Moog bass, glitchy percussion*)
4.  **Vocals:** (e.g., *Deep male baritone, robotic edge*)

### Anchor & Fracture Prompting
*   **Anchor:** Use a famous artist as a "style anchor" to lock in a specific sonic palette.
    *   *Prompt:* `In the style of Bruno Mars, Funk, Dance Pop, Groovy`
*   **Fracture:** Break the model's expectations by mixing incompatible styles to create unique sounds.
    *   *Example:* `Aggressive Trap drums + Gregorian Chant choir`

### The 3-Pass Production Method
Don't try to get the perfect song in one click. Use this iterative workflow:
1.  **The Sketch:** Generate a short version to find the "hook" and basic melody.
2.  **The Lyric Fit:** Use the "Extend" feature to feed in your custom lyrics once the vibe is locked.
3.  **The Performance Polish:** Use Suno Studio (v5) to manipulate stems, adjust levels, and add human-in-the-loop edits.

### Pro-Level Vocal Secrets
*   **Vocal Stacking:** In your `[CHORUS]`, use tags like `(Unison)`, `(Layered harmonies)`, or `(Double track)` to create a wider, professional pop sound.
*   **Narrative Arcs:** Use artists like **Ashwave** as inspiration for storytelling. Instead of generic lyrics, use "Scene Prompts":
    *   *Lyric Tag:* `[Scene: A rainy platform at midnight, ticket clutched in hand]` — Suno V5 uses this context to influence the emotional weight of the performance.

---

### Trusting the "Algorithmic Serendipity"
*   **The Philosophy:** Prompting is like directing a world-class musician. If you tell them exactly which finger to use, the performance is stiff. If you give them the *feel* and the *palette*, they will surprise you with something better than you imagined.
*   **The Strategy:** Provide the **Palette** (Style box) and the **Arc** (Lyrics field), but leave the "how" to the AI.

### Balanced Prompting Checklist
1.  **Palette (Style Box):** Lock in the instruments and genre DNA.
2.  **Anchor (Top of Lyrics):** Set the mood and scene.
3.  **Arcs (Section Tags):** Define when the energy changes.
4.  **Space:** Avoid run-on sentences in tags. Keep them punchy.
